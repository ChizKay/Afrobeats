                Afrobeat is a music genre which involves the combination of elements
                of West African musical styles such as fuji music and highlife with
                American jazz and later soul and funk influences, with a focus on 
                chanted vocals, complex intersecting rhythms, and percussion. 
                The term was coined in the 1960s by Nigerian multi-instrumentalist 
                and bandleader Fela Kuti, who is responsible for pioneering and 
                popularizing the style both within and outside Nigeria.

                Distinct from Afrobeat is Afrobeats – a sound originating in 
                West Africa in the 21st century, one which takes in diverse 
                influences and is an eclectic combination of genres such as 
                azonto, dancehall, highlife, British hip hop, hiplife, house, 
                jùjú, Naija beats, ndombolo, palm-wine, R&B and soca. 
                The two genres, though often conflated, are not the same.
